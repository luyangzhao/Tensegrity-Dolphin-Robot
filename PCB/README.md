## 🛠️ About This PCB  
This **custom PCB** integrates the **motor driver, Wi-Fi module, and power management** for the dolphin design.  

The PCB design process consists of **four key steps**:  
1️⃣ **Schematic Design** – Creating the circuit diagram and selecting components.  
2️⃣ **Component Layout** – Arranging components efficiently on the board.  
3️⃣ **Routing** – Connecting electrical traces to ensure proper functionality.  
4️⃣ **Final Adjustments** – Ground planes, vias, silkscreen labeling, and other optimizations.
