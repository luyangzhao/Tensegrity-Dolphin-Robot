# Silicone Tail Molding – CAD Files

This directory contains CAD files related to the **fabrication of the soft silicone tail**, including molding tools and reference geometry.

---

## Files Overview

### Reference Geometry (Not for Printing)

- `silicone tail final shape (no need to print).stl`  
  Final outer geometry of the silicone tail after molding.  
  This file is provided **for reference and visualization only** and **should not be printed**.  
  It represents the expected final shape of the molded silicone tail.

### Molding Components (Used for Fabrication)

The following files are used to fabricate the silicone tail via molding:

- `Mold Outer A.stl`  
  One half of the outer mold defining the external surface of the silicone tail.

- `Mold Outer B.stl`  
  The complementary half of the outer mold.  
  Together with `Mold Outer A.stl`, it forms the complete outer mold cavity.

- `Mold Inner.stl`  
  Inner mold insert used to form internal features of the silicone tail, such as internal cavities or buoyancy chambers.

## Notes

- Only the **mold components and inserts** should be fabricated (e.g., via 3D printing).
- The final silicone tail is produced by casting silicone into the assembled mold.
